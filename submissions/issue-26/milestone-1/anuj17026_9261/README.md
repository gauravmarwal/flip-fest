## CLI Feature: Add view command - Milestone 1

## Description

This PR is for issue #26.

- Created CLI view commands for accounts, contracts, deployments, networks, and emulators.
- This command shows the list of all accounts, contracts, deployments, networks, or emulators in the configuration. Eg: flow config view account --> shows a list of all accounts present in the configuration.
- It also shows the properties of a particular entity if we pass it as an argument. Eg: flow config view account accountname --> shows the properties of "accountname"
